# Pure Function

A pure function is a function which:

> 

- Given the same input, will always return the same output.

- Produces no side effects.
  which means that it canâ€™t alter any external state.

[entry]
  referential transparent: It is roughly the same as what we mean by "meaning" or "denotation" in programming language semantics.

  A context in a sentence is "referentially transparent" if replacing a term in that context by another term that refers to the same entity doesn't alter the meaning. For example

  The Scottish Parliament meets in the capital of Scotland.

  means the same as

  The Scottish Parliament meets in Edinburgh.

  usage: **memorization**
